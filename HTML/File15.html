    WH Family words are those, <b>which comprise the letters “W” & “H” and used </b>
    primarily in Interrogative sentences. These are: <strong>What, When, Where, Whose,
        Who, How, Whom, Why and Which.</strong>
    <i>WH family words & related group of words given in this lesson must be learnt by
        heart.</i> <em>Listen to its pronunciation too. </em>
    <mark>In the very first example, you can see two different meanings</mark> of „What‟; one is „D;k
    <u>‟ and another one is „tk s ‟. Fact is, when „What‟ is used in interrogative sentences, </u>
    it‟s meaning is „D;k ‟ but when „What‟ is used as a conjunction, <sup>it‟s meaning is „tks‟. </sup>
    <small>You will be taught about „Conjunctions‟ in detail a bit later</small>
